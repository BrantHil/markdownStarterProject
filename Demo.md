# An example of a project I designed and programmed alongside a partner for my final project from my previous college

## The Character Selection Screen
Seen below is the character selection screen where users are able to load or create new characters.

## The Character Information Screen
This is the bulk of the program, where users are able to input and change the information related to a DND character. The sheet also includes the standard stat modifiers calaculated.

### Upon adding this example to my demo I had plenty of time to look over what I had done previously and how much I could improve upon it, some important details are missing from the sheet as well as the poorly designed selection screen.
