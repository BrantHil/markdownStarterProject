# In Turing's writing he discusses how to make a machine be seen as a human by being a human
He mentions the machine should not just be made by men 
Wants to only allow digital computers
He wanted his test to account for all "imaginable computers" 
Does not believe randomess attributes to free will
Turing does not believe that the electronic nature of a digital computer is the same as a biological nervous system, why would turing find a distinction so unimportant/important to note that it is not a similarity that needs to be thought about?
Turing predicted that digital computers would become a universal way of using machines to preform tasks. Which is incredibly insightful for his time considering how much the modern day relies on computers to preform almost every task, and they continue to be attached to even more aspects of our lives. Examples like smart homes and smart devices.
# Turing's Responses to Objections
I like how he pushes back the Theological question that God gave man the ability to think, therefor machines cannot think. Turing puts that: *"In attempting to construct such machines we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates."* 
Turing did not even give a refute to the arguement that machines being able to think would be a detriment to society
# Post Discussion Questions and Thoughts 
Would a computer eventually be able to imagine something? If it was capable of imagination, could it then create its own machine capable of thinking?
Turing is talking about the definiton of machines and what they truely are. As in he is asking if humans could be considered machines alongside computers?
